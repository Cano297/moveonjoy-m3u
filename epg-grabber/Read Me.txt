The getEpgs.py processes multiple Electronic Program Guide (EPG) files and creates a consolidated EPG, limiting the content 
to only those channels specified in a tvg-ids.txt file. It fetches EPG files from given URLs, extracts their contents, filters 
them based on the allowed TVG IDs, and saves the result in a single EPG XML file (epg.xml).

Key Steps:
    
	Fetching EPG Files: The script downloads EPG files from specified URLs. It can handle both regular XML files and 
	compressed .gz files, decompressing them if necessary.

	Reading Allowed TVG IDs: It reads a list of allowed TVG IDs from a file named tvg-ids.txt. Only channels and programs with 
	matching TVG IDs will be included in the final EPG.

	Filtering Channels and Programs: For each fetched EPG file, the script checks the <channel> and <programme> elements. It 
	only includes those that have a TVG ID present in the tvg-ids.txt file.

	Building the Consolidated EPG: It combines all the filtered <channel> and <programme> elements from the different EPG 
	files into a single EPG XML structure.

	Saving the Final EPG: The consolidated EPG XML is saved as epg.xml, with proper encoding and XML declaration.

Purpose:

  The main objective of this script is to create a single, filtered EPG file that contains only the channels specified in 
  tvg-ids.txt. By doing so, it reduces the EPG size and ensures that only relevant channels are included, improving efficiency 
  and loading times for IPTV applications that use the generated EPG.
